    <p> I am most proficient in C/C++ but am familiar with Python and Swift for programming languages. Creating this website was supposed to help familiarize myself with HTML/CSS. For version control, I am proficient with Git.<p>
    <b>Spartan Clubs (January - May 2019)</b><br>The objective of this project was to create an app with a simple UI to help students at SJSU to easily navigate around clubs on campus.
    My role is to implement the login screen and design wireframes for the app. Despite being limited to four months with coding the app and writing documentation, the team was able to create a functioning prototype where
    the user could create an account and look at the main clubs on campus. <br>
    <b><u>Tools used:</u> </b>Mac OS, Google Firebase, and XCode<p>
      <b>Smart Parking System (October - December 2017)</b><br>For our final project, we were supposed to create something using the SJSUOne Board which is a microcontroller. Our project is about recreating the "smart parking lots"
      seen at shopping malls where there are sensors indicating whether a parking spot is vacant or not. My role in this project was to troubleshoot the servo motor that was used in our project. I gathered readings and debugged code concerning the motor. As I hate to admit it, some details of our project did not turn the way our team wanted it to be. However, the reason why I am still proud of this project regardless is because this project challenged my skills at the time.
    <br><b><u>Tools used:</u></b> SJSUOne Board (microcontroller), Hercules, Hyperload, and Eclipse (IDE)
  <p><b>IR Beacon (October - December 2017)</b><br>The goal of this project was to design a robot that will turn off a red beacon and grab a green beacon. My role was lead programmer where I programmed the robot to do the required tasks
    and I also assisted my partner in learning C.
    Our robot ended up having the fastest performance time and lightest weight out of the entire class.<br>
  <b><u>Tools used:</u></b> EasyC</p>
